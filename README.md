# Boeing-737NG-Cockpit-PFD-On-Android
A simple android app that simulates the PFD of a Boeing 737NG using Android device sensors. Try as I might to make it realistic, there are still lots of differences compared to a real 737NG PFD. Also, as this app uses Android device sensors as data sources, **it is very INACCURATE and you should ONLY USE IT FOR FUN**.

Tap the Attitude Indicator to switch on/off data text display.
